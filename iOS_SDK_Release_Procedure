suiOS SDK Release Procedure   18/11/2015
======================================

Steps to release the iOS:

1) Decide which Pull Requests (changes) will be included in the release
	• are they fixing a partner issue?
	• are there tests that verify the correctness of the change?

2) Accept the pull requests and merge them into the project.  
	• get a thumbs-up from at least one person
	• merge them one at a time, to in case there are conflicts
	• delete the branches you merge (they can be restored later if necessary)
	• DO NOT forget to deintegrate cocoapods

2) Run the pre-release script
	• from the root directory of the iOS SDK, run 'sh scripts/pre-release.sh'
	• verifies our cocoapod definition file
	• (more details! What to do if it fails?)

3) Run the release script
	• this script requires a new version number as an argument (ex: 0.8.5)	
	• from the root directory of the iOS SDK, run  'sh scripts/release.sh <version>'  (ex 0.8.5)
	• this script does several things:
		• it opens the changelog on the command line.  add release notes here and save them
		• it builds the framework and cocoapod
		• it commits everything to github, including cocoapod tags
		• it pushes the pod to Cocoapods.org
		• it uploads the build to amazon s3
		• it opens the google group where we announce releases; have your work browser open and logged in to gmail
		• announce the release!
