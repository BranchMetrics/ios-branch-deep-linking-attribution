iOS SDK Release Procedure
=========================
### Last update: 1/4/2016

# Steps to release the iOS SDK:

1) Decide which Pull Requests (changes) will be included in the release
    • are they fixing a partner issue?
    • are there tests that verify the correctness of the change?

2) Accept the pull requests and merge them into the staging branch of the project.
    • get a thumbs-up from at least one person
    • merge them one at a time, to verify no conflicts
    • delete the branches you merge (they can be restored later if necessary)

3) When you're ready to prepare a release, merge the 'staging' branch into the 'QA' branch.
   This keeps the staging branch unblocked for continuos development.
   - All final testing is done on the QA branch of the code.
   - All fixes for bugs found while testing are made to the QA branch.
   - QA the release candidate:
     * Does it compile in Xcode 8?
     * Does it pass static analysis?
     * Does it pass all the manual tests?
       (test suite ref...)
     * Does it compile in Xcode 7?
     * Do all of the code examples compile?
       - TestBed
       - TestBed-Swift
       - TestBed-iMessenger, etc.

4) Congratulations!  All tests have passed.  The code is sleek.  Everything is documented.
   Time to make a release.

5) For a Beta release, on the QA branch:
   - Update the version number. ./scripts/version -i
   - Update the release notes in ./ChangeNotes.md.
   - Merge the 'QA' branch into 'beta' branch.
   - Merge the 'QA' branch into the 'staging' branch.
   - Talk with Elizabeth about sending an email announcement to the beta testers.
   - Done!

6) For a production release (from either 'beta' or 'QA'):
   - Check out and pull the latest code from that branch.
   - Update the version number ./scripts/version -im
   - Update the release notes in ./ChangeNotes.md
   - The script ./scripts/deploy-release is a master script that calls the other deploy scripts.
     Each part of the deploy is broken out so if that part fails or needs to be re-run for some
     reason, It is broken into parts so that each step can be run individually if needed.

3) Run the pre-release script
    • from the root directory of the iOS SDK, run 'sh scripts/pre-release.sh'
    • verifies our cocoapod definition file
    • (more details! What to do if it fails?)

4) Run the release script
    • this script requires a new version number as an argument (ex: 0.8.5)
    • from the root directory of the iOS SDK, run  'sh scripts/release.sh <version>'  (ex 0.8.5)
    • this script does several things:
        • it opens the changelog on the command line. Add release notes here and save them.
        • it builds the framework and cocoapod
        • it commits everything to github, including cocoapod tags
        • it pushes the pod to Cocoapods.org
        • it uploads the build to amazon s3
        • it opens the google group where we announce releases; have your work browser open and
          logged in to gmail.
        • Announce the release!

5) Release on Fabric
    => New!! <=
    • On the command line, cd to 'ios-branch-deep-linking'.
    • Run the script './scripts/deploy-fabric <version>'.
    • The script will compress and upload the framework, then the Fabric.app application will open.
    • Verify the deploy by going to the Fabric Mac app, choose 'Branch' and check the version number.
    • More details to be found here: https://github.com/twitterdev/3pk/wiki/Updating-SDKs

    The old procedure (I'll delete this part from the doc soon):
    • Zip the .framework file
    • run the following curl from the same directory and make sure to use the correct SDK version (note: currently, get the key from Ahmed or Sojan)
    curl --fail -v -X PUT -H "X-FabricKits-ApiKey: $iOS_API_KEY" \
   -F "release_metadata={\"description\": \"Deep links to drive app installs, user engagement and retention across all channels\", \"friendly-name\": \"Branch\",\"learn-more-url\": \"https://dev.branch.io\", \"release-channel\":\"public\"};type=application/json" \
   -F "release_artifact=@Branch.framework.zip;type=application/octet-stream" \
   https://kits.fabric.io/manage-api/v1/kit-releases/ios/io.branch.sdk.ios/0.12.7
   • More details to be found here: https://github.com/twitterdev/3pk/wiki/Updating-SDKs
   • Verify by going to the Fabric Mac app, choose Branch and check the version number.

6) Release on Carthage
    => New!! <=
    • On the command line, cd to 'ios-branch-deep-linking'.
    • Run the script './scripts/deploy-carthage'.
    • The script will check and compile the framework.  Then the web page
      'https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking/releases/new' will open.

    Draft a new release:
    • Choose the release version, put some funny (required!) title and add the ChangeLog to the description.
    • In the attachment section, choose the zipped framework in the 'carthage-files' directory
      (different from the fabric one).
    • Publish the release.

    The old procedure (I'll delete this part from the doc soon):
    • cd to carthage-files
    • Run the Xcode project and make sure it compiles
    • run 'carthage build --no-skip-current && carthage archive Branch'
    • go to https://github.com/BranchMetrics/ios-branch-deep-linking/releases and click on Draft a
      new release.
    • Choose the release version, put some funny (required!) title and add the ChangeLog to the
      Description field.
    • In the attachment sections, choose the zipped framework in the carthage-files directory
      (different from the fabric one).
    • Publish Release

Important Note about Carthage:
    • The Carthage Xcode project is separate from the main Testbed one, however, the SDK-related
      files in this project are symbolic links to the main ones (so that updates to the original
      files are reflected in Carthage).
    • This means if you add new files to the main Xcode Project, make sure to add them to the
      Carthage one as well (but not as copies).

7) Rejoice and pay tribute to Steve Jobs!
