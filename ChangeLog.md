- Fixed script in "Run Script" phase of static framework targets

v.3.4.3
- Fix push notifications when app is backgrounded and the app uses `handlePushNotification` instead of `handleDeeplink`

v.3.4.2

- SDK behavior change to fix a race condition when opening a closed app with a link. In some apps, this race condition could cause the occasional loss of link data.
 
When opening a closed app with a link, the Branch SDK will no longer attempt to merge the app open and link arrival lifecycle events. Apps will now get called on "app open" and on "link arrival", which are often very close together. If your app ignores callbacks with no link data, then this change should be transparent.

v.3.2.0
- Add support for setting DMA compliance parameters.
- Update logging to allow a custom callback so clients may reroute Branch Logs to their logging infrastructure.
- Update logging to use `os_log` private by default.

- Improve Swift compatibility by removing API variations that differ only by an NSError.

v.3.1.0
- Fix tuist SPM integration when using external by switching to a more typical SPM layout.

Note this release is only being deployed to the SPM repo to unblock tuist users. A follow up release will address compatibility between this bugfix and other integration methods. 

v.3.0.1
- Fix organic open when app is already running in background.

v.3.0.0

- Add a Privacy Manifest for the Branch SDK. App developers may need add an App level Privacy Manifest for data they collect and pass into the Branch SDK.
    - Known Issue: When using cocoapods without the `use_frameworks!` option, the build can fail with a duplicate privacy manifest error. Workaround is to manually merge privacy manifests.
- Add support for a tracking domain. When Ads tracking is enabled, the SDK sends event calls to a tracking domain.

  * _*Master Release*_ - March 27, 2018
  * Added a field to set an email subject without adding it as a link parameter.
    - The field is BranchShareLink.emailSubject.
    - This is analogous to the similar Android option.
    - Updated the Branch code to use the newer `activityViewController:subjectForActivityType:`
      delegate as well as support the old style set-undocumented-option-on-view-controller way.
    - Setting an email subject for Gmail is still broken. This is a Gmail problem and I've
      filed an issue with Gmail (GitHub #789).
  * After sharing a link in Skype, the link would open in the app as if a deferred deep linking had
    happened (DEVEX-278, GitHub #793).
    - Fixed this so that Skype content scraping doesn't trigger a deferred deep link.
  * Don't print expected HTTP status 404 error pages because it looks like an error (GitHub #800).
  * Fixed Airdrop of a URL scheme link open (INTENG-4106).
  * Fixed a Fabric share content event bug.

  * _*Master Release*_ - March 7, 2018
  * Updated the CocoaPod podspec for compatibility with frameworks when Branch is used as a dependency.

- v0.23.1
  * _*Master Release*_ - March 6, 2018
  * Removed test features.
  * Added more URL black list tests.
  * Added more analyzer checks.

- v0.23.0
  * Added URL Black List for sensitive URLs (DEVEX-164).

    Set this property to prevent URLs with sensitive content such as oauth tokens,
    passwords, login data, and other data from being transmitted to Branch.

    The Branch SDK already ignores login URLs for Facebook, Twitter, Google, and most oauth
    security URLs, so it's usually unnecessary to set this parameter yourself.

    Set this parameter with any additional URLs that should be ignored by Branch.

  * Added an SDK integration validator.

    Use the SDK integration validator to check that you've added the Branch SDK and handle
    deep links correctly when you first integrate Branch into your app.

    To check your integration, add the line:

    ```
    [[Branch getInstance] validateSDKIntegration];
    ```

    in your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method in your app delegate. Then run your
    app and follow the instructions.

    This is for testing in development only! Make sure you remove or comment out this line of code in
    your release versions.

    See [SDK Integration Validator](https://docs.branch.io/pages/resources/validation-tools/#overview_1) for more information.

  * Added a Deeplink Routing Validator

    Append validate=true to your Branch links to test and verify if they route the user
    to the correct content.

    See [Deeplink Validator](https://docs.branch.io/pages/resources/validation-tools/#overview_1) for more information.

  * Bug fix for automatic deeplinking controller:
    - To support old and new API for automatic deeplinking Controller, there are two types of value
      existed in deepLinkControllers dictionary: BNCDeepLinkViewControllerInstance and UIViewController.
      The variable `branchSharingController.deepLinkingCompletionDelegate = self` was set before
      checking type of the `deepLinkControllers`' value.

- v0.19.5

    more flexibility when handling scheme-based URLs.  The methods are:

```
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
                    openURL:(NSURL *)url
          sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication
                 annotation:(id)annotation;

  * All the unit tests now compile, run, and pass.
  * Added the `branchAPIURL` property to `BNCPreferenceHelper` instances.
      This property can be set when testing with mocking frameworks like WireMock, where canned
      server responses are needed for functional testing scenarios.

      This property can be set before Branch is initialized.  For example:
      ```objc
      [BNCPreferenceHelper preferenceHelper].branchAPIURL = @"http://localhost/branch-mock";
      [[Branch getInstance] initSessionWithLaunchOptions:launchOptions];
      ```

- v0.7.0
  * Large rewrite of the internals of Branch.m to make things more stable, predictable, readable, and maintainable.
  * Added callbacks to the `redeemRewards` methods.
  * Updating Queue persistence to be non-immediate. Rather than persisting to disk on every change, it persists after time has elapsed to prevent hanging issues when in a loop.
  * Making errors more specific -- now you actually get the error message back, instead of a generic one.
  * Fixing issue with BranchActivityItemProvider when using the Twitter share sheet.
  * Removing temporary backwards compat typedefs.

- v0.6.0: We have deprecated the use of `bnc_app_key` and are now using `branch_key`, which can be obtained in the settings page of your Dashboard. The replacement in the SDK should happen in the plist, as well as in `+(Branch *)getInstance:(NSString *)branchKey;` if necessary.

- v0.5.9: Revert of the URI Scheme updates.

- v0.5.8:
  * Fixing an issue with the creation of NSError userInfo dictionaries.
  * Updating behavior of URI Scheme detection -- you should now name the scheme you want to use "io.branch.sdk." The previous behavior will be maintained for some time.
  * You can additionally specify which scheme to use via `[[Branch getInstance] setUriScheme:@"myapp://"]`

- v0.5.7: Adding handling around the Facebook share sheet to prevent incorrect link clicks. Removing `branch_key` warning message.

- v0.5.6: Issue sending proper update to server if isReferrable not set

- v0.5.5: Reverting branch_key change until server component is updated. Fixing an issue with getShortUrl failures causing crashes.

- v0.5.4: A large number of changes have been included in this version, but all are backwards compatibile.
  * Retry Number has been added to all requests, so that the server is able to differentiate.
  * Organization of some of the encoding methods in the repository has been centralized.
  * Fixed an encoding bug with empty param dictionaries and arrays.
  * A couple of encoding issues were fixed, and a large number of tests have been added.
  * Perhaps most importantly, the `branch_key` is now replacing the `bnc_app_key` and `app_id` items. For now, both will continue to work, but the non-`branch_key` items are deprecated, and will be removed with `0.6.0`.
  * The presence of `app_id` and `branch_key` has been ensured across all requests, no longer piecemeal.
